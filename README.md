# 📊 FinTech Loan Default Risk Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **real-world FinTech loan data** to identify **loan default risk patterns** using SQL.  
The goal is to understand how borrower characteristics such as **credit grade, income level, and loan purpose** impact loan defaults.

The analysis is performed entirely using **SQL** on a dataset containing **over 1 million loan records**, simulating real-world credit risk analysis used by banks and FinTech companies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical loan data to identify default trends  
- Define and calculate key default risk metrics  
- Segment default risk by credit grade, income group, and loan purpose  
- Generate insights useful for lending and risk assessment decisions  

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** Lending Club Loan Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Records:** ~1,048,575 loans
- **Type:** Real-world peer-to-peer lending data

### Key Columns Used
- `id` – Loan identifier  
- `loan_amnt` – Loan amount  
- `term` – Loan tenure (36/60 months)  
- `int_rate` – Interest rate  
- `grade` – Credit grade (A–G)  
- `annual_inc` – Annual income  
- `loan_status` – Current status of the loan  
- `purpose` – Reason for taking the loan  
- `addr_state` – Borrower state  

---

## 🧠 Business Logic: Default Definition
For this analysis, a loan is classified as **defaulted** if its `loan_status` is:

- `Charged Off`
- `Default`
- `Late (31–120 days)`

This definition aligns with common **credit risk assessment practices**.

---

## 📐 Key Metrics Calculated
- Total number of loans  
- Number of defaulted loans  
- Overall default rate (%)  
- Default distribution by:
  - Credit grade  
  - Loan purpose  
  - Income group  

---

## 🧪 SQL Analysis Performed
The project uses **core SQL concepts**, including:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- `CASE` statements for conditional logic
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`)
- Handling large-scale datasets efficiently

All queries are written with **business clarity and readability** in mind.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Loan default risk increases significantly as credit grade moves from **A to G**
- **Debt consolidation** loans contribute the highest share of defaults
- Lower income segments show higher concentration of defaulted loans
- Credit grade is the strongest predictor of loan default among analyzed factors
